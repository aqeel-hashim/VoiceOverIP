Compile and run with:

javac VoipClient.java
java VoipClient <server ip> <port>

The authors humbly suggest copying the .java into
Eclipse on Windows, and proceeding to run the application
from there. 

Note:
VoipClient is the standard implementation for direct
calls between two users.

VoipClientM is the implementation for conference calling,
but operates in the same manner as VoipClient. The
reason for this is that VoipClientM makes use of 
multi-casting whereas VoipClient does not.

ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS :D

Make sure to turn up one's mic and sound volume to MAX.
